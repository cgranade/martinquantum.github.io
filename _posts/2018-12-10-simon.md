title: Everything you always wanted to know about Simon's algorithm (but were afraid to ask)
---

<b>TLDR:</b> This post deals with Simon's algorithm and shows how to implement it in Q#. We also managed to track down its creator Dan Simon, who was successfully hiding for 24 years in a Microsoft building until we found him using the corporate directory, and finally we share an anecdote about the two FOCS'94 quantum papers that might be new to some. 

## Recap: 1994, the year in which it all began

1994 was an eventful year. Some folks held their breath watching a white Ford Bronco in a high-speed car chase. Others enjoyed the new Euro tunnel feature that facilitated travel between France and England. A movie educated us about mouthwatering Big Kahuna burgers and the world-famous Jack Rabbit Slims Twist Contest. The world of figure scating saw the national champion stripped of her title. And in the world of animated sitcoms, America was introduced to two delightful teenagers who entertained us with their hilarious exploits. Moreover, 1994 is considered by many as the year when quantum computing went into warp speed after being considered a mere curiosity in the years prior. 

While some encouraging results about this new model of computation were already known by then, such as the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm for Fourier sampling which---upon applying a nifty recursive construction---can be shown to give an advantage over classical computing that is bigger than any polynomial, the opening bell for age of quantum computing was really rung at FOCS 1994 which featured two seminal papers introducing Shor's quantum algorithms for solving discrete logarithms and for factoring of integers and Simon's quantum algorithm for figuring out bit-masks that describe the collisions of certain 2-to-1 functions. 

Due to its impacts on cryptography---after all, it shatters many of the primitives on which currently deployed public key cryptography relies---the former quantum algorithm is often mentioned as a poster child for quantum computing. Simon's algorithm has received quite a bit less attention, is however no less important nor less interesting.

                // the result of each measurement is converted to a 0/1 value

                    if (M(xs[indexBitmask]) == One)

                        set resultBitmask[indexBitmask] = 1;
                    }
                }

                // before releasing the qubits make sure they are all in the |0‚ü© state
                ResetAll(qs);
            }

            return resultBitmask;
        }
